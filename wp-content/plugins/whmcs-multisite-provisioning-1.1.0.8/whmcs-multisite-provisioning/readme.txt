== Description ==

This plugin allows provisioning of blogs on a Wordpress multi-site installation from external WHMCS packages and billing system.
Includes provisioning for Subdomain, Subdirectory or Domain Mapping Wordpress Multisite installs.

The plugin's /whmcs directory contains modules to be installed on WHMCS to communicate with this plugin.

The current version Is from WHMCS to Wordpress only. Some fields will sync to WHMCS automatically such as username, domain, path. Changes to these are locked out at WHMCS admin. 
Passwords may be chaged from WHMCS Admin but they DO NOT feed back from Wordpress to WHMCS. Wordpress passwords are hashed and can't be read in clear.

== Installation of Wordpress Plugin ==

1. Upload the 'whmcs-multisite-provisioning' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Network activate the plugin on the Network Admin of your multi-site Wordpress installation through the Network Admin's 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. On the settings page currently nothing is required to be set.
4. If you set allowed IP addresses they must contain the IP of your WHMCS server. Blank turns off IP filtering.
5. Other fields are non-functional to be added in the future.
6. That's all the config necessary.

== Installation of WHMCS Modules ==

Copy the whmcs/Modules directory over your Modules directory in your WHMCS installation.
This adds a Server Module named "whmcs_multisite" and an Addon module named "whmcs_multisite".

IMPORTANT: Create an Administrator in WHMCS who will authorize Multisite products. This is necessary to authorize Wordpress to update your 
service information after a site is created. If not filled in the Product creation will fail. 
The only important part is that the username has administartor level permission to create the product.

1. In WHMCS admin go to Setup | Servers and Add New Server

== Known Issues ==
1. If a user does not already exist on Wordpress as determined by matching the WHMCS Clients email 
with the Wordpress users email, a new user will be created using the WHMCS Client's email address and 
the portion before the '@' as the users name. If you are Accepting Orders in Admin before creation you 
can change the default username there. Once the username is created it cannot be changed. 

2. If the WHMCS clients email address already exists as a user in Wordpress the Wordpress user account 
will override what you may put in WHMCS. Wordpress user names can not be changed and this is enforced in WHMCS.

3. WHMCS generates random passwords when creating a service. If a new Wordpress user is 
created as a result this random password is the password for the new user. If the user already exists 
in Wordpress WHMCS still generates a random password but it does NOT change the Wordpress password. 
WHMCS can change the password on Wordpress but Wordpress password changes will not be feed back to WHMCS.

4. Each WHMCS service creates different random passwords so they will not match if a Client has more than one 
service at the same Wordpress site.
