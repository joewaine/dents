== 1.1 ==
- Back peddled on the base64 encoding. Some javascript was building urls from variables and tacking extra &name=value items to the end of the url.
This messed up the encoding and broke things like the remove link on the order forms.
- New scheme to avoid the http security filters is to rename the "http://" and "https://" in front of the url to "whmcs://" and "whmcss://"
The plugin automatically translates back and forth.
- Repaired whmcs translation on ajax calls.
- Added javascript caching and patching to fix WHMCS non-standard javascript file and redirect posts.
- Fixed class-http patch for WPv3.4
- Left the URL encoder in except it now does urlencode as before instead of base 64.

- Added Default Content Page to settings. When set this is the page that wHMCS menu items will go to when clicked.
Assuming it has a content shortcode there it will display the content.

= 1.0.4 =
- Because of some security filters that trigger on the "http://" on shared servers like Hostgator the redirect urls are now
base64 encoded to prevent triggering the filter.
